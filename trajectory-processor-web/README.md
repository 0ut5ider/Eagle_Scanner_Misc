# Trajectory Processor Web App

This web application converts the Eagle Scanner's trajectory processor from Python to a browser-based tool. It allows users to process image positions using trajectory data without requiring any server-side components or Python installation.

## Features

- Drag and drop interface for selecting image folders and trajectory files
- Client-side processing of image positions
- Progress tracking during processing
- Downloadable CSV output file
- Fully browser-based with no server requirements

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)

2. **Select Image Folder**
   - Drag and drop a folder containing JPG images onto the "Image Folder" drop zone
   - Alternatively, click the drop zone and select a folder using the file picker
   - The application will recursively find all JPG images in the folder and its subfolders

3. **Select Trajectory File**
   - Drag and drop a trajectory file onto the "Trajectory File" drop zone
   - Alternatively, click the drop zone and select a file using the file picker
   - The trajectory file should be in the format generated by RayStudio (space-separated values)

4. **Process the Data**
   - Click the "Begin Processing" button to start processing
   - A progress bar will show the current status of the processing
   - Once complete, a download link for the output CSV file will appear

5. **Download Results**
   - Click the "Download pose_output.csv" link to save the processed data

## Technical Details

The application performs the following steps:

1. Reads the trajectory file to extract timestamps and position coordinates
2. Extracts timestamps from image filenames
3. For each image, finds the nearest timestamps in the trajectory data
4. Interpolates position (x, y, z) values for each image timestamp
5. Generates a CSV file with the processed position data

## Browser Compatibility

This application uses modern web APIs and is compatible with:
- Chrome 76+
- Firefox 68+
- Edge 79+
- Safari 13.1+

For the best experience, please use the latest version of your browser.

## Privacy

All processing is done entirely in your browser. No data is sent to any server, and no information is stored beyond the current browser session.

## Limitations

- Large files may cause performance issues in some browsers
- The directory selection feature may have limited support in some browsers
- The application requires JavaScript to be enabled

## Original Python Implementation

This web application is based on the Eagle Scanner's trajectory processor Python script. The original implementation can be found in the `image_positions` directory of the Eagle Scanner repository.
