# Product Context: Eagle Scanner GPS Processing Tools

## Problem Statement
The Eagle Scanner project requires efficient processing of GPS data from various sources and formats. Specifically:

1. **ROS1 Bag Conversion Challenge**: GPS data stored in ROS1 bag files with custom message types needs conversion to standard NMEA format without requiring ROS1 installation
2. **Trajectory Processing**: Need to correlate image timestamps with GPS positions for photogrammetry workflows
3. **Format Standardization**: Multiple GPS data formats need to be unified for downstream processing

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Tools should work without complex dependencies or installations
- **Speed**: Fast processing of large GPS datasets (hundreds of messages)
- **Reliability**: Accurate coordinate preservation and format conversion
- **Flexibility**: Support for different input/output formats and custom configurations

## Key Use Cases
1. **Drone Survey Processing**: Convert ROS1 bag files from drone GPS systems to NMEA for GIS software
2. **Image Geotagging**: Match image timestamps to GPS coordinates for photogrammetry
3. **Trajectory Analysis**: Process and visualize flight paths and survey patterns
4. **Data Integration**: Prepare GPS data for Metashape and other photogrammetry tools

## Success Metrics
- All GPS messages successfully converted (486/486 in test case)
- Proper NMEA format compliance with valid checksums
- Coordinate accuracy preservation
- Processing speed suitable for operational workflows
- Zero dependency on ROS1 installation

## Target Users
- Drone operators and survey technicians
- Photogrammetry specialists
- GIS analysts
- Research teams working with GPS data
