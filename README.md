# Eagle_Scanner_Misc
Various pieces of code for making life simpler with the Eagle lidar scanner

## Image Positions
This python script will generate a csv file containing positional information for all the images taken by the cameras on the Eagle scanner.
The positional (tralslation and rotation) come from the trajectory file generated by Ray Studio. 
The trajectory file contains a timestamp along with translation/rotation in a local coordinate system.
All the images captured by the eagle scanner are given filenames which are the timestamps when the image was taken. 

The script simply looks at the image filename (timestamp) and compares it to the nearest timestamp in the trajectory file. It then linearly interpoates the translations/rotations from the nearest neighbours.

### Usage
Running `python trajectory_processor.py -h` will display the available options.

`python trajectory_processor.py --trajectory /path/to/your/trajectory.txt --image_folder /path/to/your/images --output_csv /path/to/output.csv`
